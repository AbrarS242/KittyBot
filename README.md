# KittyBot
- A bot for the CS@unimelb Discord server.
- This bot is made using **Hikari** & **Lightbulb**. These 2 nice & simple **Python** libraries.
- The docs for these 2 libraries are https://www.hikari-py.dev/hikari/ & https://hikari-lightbulb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.
- This guide is very nice if you want to quickly understand how these libraries work: https://neonjonn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hikari-get-started/lightbulb.html
- Pull requests are very much accepted if you want to add features to bot & server!
- If you want to play around with it, you will need to use your own bot token (this is all in the above guide) :)
