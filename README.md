# KittyBot
- A bot for the CS@unimelb Discord server.
- This bot is made using **Hikari** & **Lightbulb**. These are 2 nice & simple **Python** libraries.
- The docs for these 2 libraries are https://www.hikari-py.dev/hikari/ & https://hikari-lightbulb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.
- The following *get-started* guide is very nice if you want to quickly understand how these libraries work: https://neonjonn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hikari-get-started/lightbulb.html
- Pull requests are very much accepted if you want to add features to the bot & server!
- If you want to play around with it, you will need to use your own bot token. You could then invite your own bot (with the token you got) to your own personal server and play around with it there for testing (this is all in the above guide) :)
- You can install the required dependencies (listed in `requirements.txt`) using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
